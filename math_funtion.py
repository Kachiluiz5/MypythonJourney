x = 2.9
print(round(x))  # this is the buildin round function
print(abs(-2.9))  # the absolute: we give it a value and it alsways returns the positive representation
# of that value even if the value is negetive

# if you want to run a program that involves complex mathematics calculations, you need to import
# the math module

# A module in python is a seprate file with some reusable code. we use this modules to organize our codes into
# different files

import math

print(math.ceil(2.9))
print(math.floor(2.9))

# to practice all module : go to google => python 3 math module
